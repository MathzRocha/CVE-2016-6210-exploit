# CVE-2016-6210-exploit
Custom exploit written for enumerating usernames as per CVE-2016-6210

## DESCRIPTION

I wrote this program as a tool to exploit CVE-2016-6210, which is a vulnerability in OpenSSH (before version 7.3) [disclosed by Eddie Harari](https://vuldb.com/?id.89622)

From what I understand, the problem is that the way OpenSSH worked in these versions means that when given a large password (in this case 10kb),
the hashing processing times mean that we can tell whether a username exists or not, as the amount of time is higher for valid users


Credit goes to Eddie Harari for some of the code in `cveCode.py`: a modified version of Harari's code is used for sending and 
testing response times. His advisory and sample code can be found [here](https://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2016/Jul/51)

_Note: My code has only been black-box tested, and needs further testing. However, it functions as intended, and the results and parameters
are in the user's control_

## USAGE

`exploit_6210.py IP_ADDRESS [-h] [-a ALERT] [-w WORDLIST] [-e EMAIL]`

Where:

> IP_ADDRESS	is the host that you are testing the program against

> -a ALERT	is the amount of time (in seconds) for which you would like an alert to be made if the processing time is larger

> -w WORDLIST	is the filepath for the list of usernames you would like to test against the host

> -e EMAIL	is the email (which should look like: @email.com) you would like to try on the end of each element in the wordlist (note that both the item AND the item + email will be tried)
